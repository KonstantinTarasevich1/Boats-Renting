# Boats Renting System

## Project Overview

The Boats Renting System is a web application designed to streamline the process of renting boats. It provides both a user-friendly interface for customers and robust backend functionality for managing bookings, boats, and user information. The system consists of two main components:

- **BoatsRentingSystem.API**: A RESTful API that serves as the backend of the application, handling business logic, data processing, and communication with the database.
- **BoatsRentingSystem.MVC**: A frontend MVC-based web application that provides an intuitive interface for customers and administrators to interact with the system.

## Key Features

- **Boat Listings**: Display available boats with details such as type, capacity, and pricing.
- **Booking Management**: Allows customers to book boats and view their reservations.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system for customers and administrators.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage boats, bookings, and user accounts.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility across devices for a seamless user experience.
